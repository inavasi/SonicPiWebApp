To get started you'll need

A Midi Port, f.e.
`LoopMidi` 


please open the file "midiListener1.rb" in Sonic Pi and
set up LoopMidi (or another virtual Loopback-MIDI-Port) and make sure it's unmuted. 

change path names in the code if needed ( of tAKEmEtOtHEtOP.wav used in last live_loop in "midiListener1.rb" or the Port Name of the virtual Loopback-MIDI-Port, I used a Port Named: "loopMIDI Port" as the output (Piano.js, Drums.js, Buttons.js, Slider.js )

change to 
### `cd my-app`


RUN the sonic Pi file "midiListener1.rb" when the app is set up as described in the README.md of my-app
